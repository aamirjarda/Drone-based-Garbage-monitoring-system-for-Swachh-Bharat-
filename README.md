## Drone-based Garbage Monitoring System for Swachh Bharat" project, here is a step-by-step guide:

**1. Project Planning and Requirement Gathering**

* Define project goals: Drone-based detection and monitoring of garbage and potholes in urban areas.
* Identify technical requirements, including hardware (drones, GPS), and software (image processing, machine learning).

**2. Literature Review and Research**
* Review related research on drone technology and machine learning applications for environmental monitoring.
* Focus on issues like privacy, air safety, and regulatory policies concerning drones.

**3. Design the Proposed System Model**

* Outline the main components: Drone control, image capture, data processing, and notification.
* Design the flight path and waypoint system using GPS-based algorithms.
* Implement image analysis methods to classify and assess garbage density and potholes.

**4. Technology and Tools Setup**

* Select and configure hardware: Recommended DJI Phantom 3 quadcopter or similar with GPS.
* Set up TensorFlow for training the model, using labeled data for garbage, clean roads, and potholes.
* Integrate image recognition via GoogleNet/Inception model for precise analysis.

**5. Data Collection**

* Gather initial image data for training: Photos of streets with varying levels of cleanliness and potholes.
* Capture and label images as garbage, potholes, clean roads, etc., using the drone and additional sources.

**6. Model Training and Implementation**

* Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the prepared dataset.
* Conduct iterative training, validation, and testing to optimize accuracy for real-time identification.

**7. System Integration and Testing**

* Test the modelâ€™s performance with real-time images captured by the drone.
* Fine-tune the model and system configurations to improve accuracy and response time.

**8. Deployment and Monitoring**

* Deploy the system in selected urban areas for pilot testing.
* Monitor drone data, analyze system performance, and make adjustments as needed.

**9. Evaluation and Reporting**

* Analyze system accuracy, operational costs, and manpower reduction effectiveness.
* Compile findings into a final report, including recommendations for scalability and improvements.
