### Paper 2 - Analysis of localization for drone-fleet

The authors of this paper are Jin-Hyeok Kang, Kyung-Joon Park, Hwangnam Kim presented at  on ICTC internation conference on 2015. 

However, GPS is unable to find the location in indoor area or None Line of Sight (NLOS), and  this may be serious for the drone because we may lose the control of the drone. Problems in  Drone fleet:  
* First drone moves vertically as well as horizontally with respect to car, humans move  horizontally, that changes the localization for the flying of the drone. 
* Usually drone go from land to aerial area that may have different environment compare  to ground, so the easy flying of the drone between ground and aerial area is difficult. 
* Location approximation fault is critical to drone because if the drone gets wrong  location, it affects the mission achievement and location error may cause the drone to  damage and may result in collision. 
Some of the techniques like GPS, Received Signal Strength Indicator(RSSI), Angel of Arrival(AOA), Time of Arrival(TOA) is discussed in this paper.
